      <li>6cups thinly sliced, peeled apples (6 medium)</li>
      <li>3/4cup sugar</li>
      <li>2tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3/4teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/8teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>One package (12 oz) frozen Pillsbury™ Deep Dish Pie Crusts 
        (2 Count) may be substituted for the refrigerated Pillsbury™ Pie Crusts in this recipe.
         Place cookie sheet on oven rack. Heat oven as directed.
             Prepare filling and follow directions on package for Two-Crust Filled Pie.</li>
        <li>The flour tossed with the fresh apples turns their juices into a thickened,
             spiced sauce during baking.
             Mix it with the sugar and spices before tossing the mixture with the apples.</li>  
        <li>Two (21-oz.) cans of more fruit apple pie filling can be used if you're short on time.</li>
        <li>Let your apple pie cool for at least 2 hours before cutting into it.
             The filling will thicken as it cools, making it easier to slice.</li>
        <li>To make Caramel-Pecan Apple Pie:
             right after removing the pie from the oven,
              drizzle with 1/3 cup caramel ice cream topping.
               Sprinkle with 2 to 4 tablespoons chopped pecans.</li>    
        <li>To freeze Baked Pie: Assemble and bake pie as directed in recipe.
             Cool completely. Wrap pie tightly with plastic wrap.
              Place pie in a 2-gallon freezer storage bag; seal. Freeze up to 4 months.
               Thaw frozen baked pie unwrapped at room temperature or unwrap and thaw at room 
               temperature 1 hour,
             then heat in 375°F oven 35 to 40 minutes or until warm.</li>  
        <li>Enjoy !!!</li>
